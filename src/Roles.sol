/// @notice Minimal two-tier access control shared by the zk-kyc-pass contracts:
///         a single `owner` (governance) and a set of `agents` (operational
///         actors). This mirrors the owner/agent split of ERC-3643 (T-REX)
///         without vendoring the full suite — the same house style as the RWA
///         tokenization demo it composes with.
/// @dev The deployer is set as BOTH owner and the first agent in the
///      constructor, so a freshly deployed contract is immediately operable by
///      the deployer alone — which is exactly how this demo is wired: every
///      privileged role resolves to the single deployer address.
